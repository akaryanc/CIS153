# CIS153
My CIS153 Final Project
The plan for my project is to have a user enter sales data for carnival games. The data entered will track the game played, amount of money generated for the day, and the category of the game type. This information will be stored in a text file. The final part of this project is to have a script that can access the stored data. The user can see how much money the games made total and the average amount per day. Also, the total amount for each category and the average each category made per day.

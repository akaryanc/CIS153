Final Project
CIS-153-01A

	This is actually two programs that work together and use the same database file. The first program allows you to create and add lines of information into the database. It is made to enter income from canival games and has a tkinter interface. The second program is a program that looks at the information that was entered with the first program and does some math to give you daily averages and total income. Both programs should be in the same folder and I provided a gamesincome.txt database file that is prepopulated so the second program is able to have data to pull from.
	My biggest challenge in coding this project was I had no idea what tkinter was or what it did. I had to do research and watch some videos to learn what it does and how to implement it into my programs. I beleive I met all the requirements of the project and I'm happy with how it turned out at my coding skill level.
	I did not recieve any help from outsides sources. I referenced my textbook for help and watched some youtube videos on the channel thenewboston that introduced me to what tkinter was and the basics of how it worked.


	My programs were written in Python 3.9 and used the libraries tkinter, re, and math which are all included in Python 3.9 by default. I wrote the programs using Atom and run the scripts from that program. If I had more time I would be interested in learning how to get results from a range of dates.
